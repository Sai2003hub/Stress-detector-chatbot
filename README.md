🧠 AI Conversational Chatbot for Stress Detection (AICCSD)
AICCSD is an advanced AI-powered system designed to monitor employee stress in real-time through natural conversations and gamified assessments. It combines the power of:

🤖 Gemini API for empathetic dialogue

🧠 Fine-tuned DistilBERT model for contextual stress analysis

🔍 DistilBERT for lie detection and identifying deceptive responses

The system includes three cognitive games:

🎯 Stroop Test – evaluates attention and processing speed

🧩 Crisis Management Simulation – tests decision-making under pressure

🎈 Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) – assesses risk tolerance and impulse control

All stress indicators — linguistic, emotional, and behavioral — are analyzed, and predictions are securely shared with administrators via a privacy-preserving dashboard to enable timely and ethical interventions.
